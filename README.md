In this project, I use Pandas to generate a dataframe with the most promising cancer treatments and their results, and proceed to visualize it using matplotlib. Some of the most important findings were: Capomulin and Ramicane proved to be the two most effective drugs in the study,
the larger the mice the bigger the tummors they had with a correlation of .84, and the ratio from male to female was close to 1:1.
